					<h4>What Are My Whitening Options?</h4>
					
						<h4>Whitening Toothpastes</h4>
							<p>All toothpastes help remove surface stain through the action of mild abrasives that scrub the teeth.  Look for the ADA Seal for safe whitening toothpastes that have special chemical or polishing agents to provide additional stain removal effectiveness. Unlike bleaches, these types of ADA Accepted products do not change the color of teeth because they can only remove stains on the surface.</p>
						
						<h4>In-Office Bleaching</h4>
							<p>This procedure is called chairside bleaching and usually requires only one office visit. The dentist will apply either a protective gel to your gums or a rubber shield to protect your gums. Bleach is then applied to the teeth. A special light or laser might be used to enhance the action of the whitening agent.</p>

						<h4>At-Home Bleaching</h4>
							<p>Peroxide-containing whiteners actually bleach the tooth enamel. They typically come in a gel and are placed in a tray that fits on your teeth. You may also use a whitening strip that sticks to your teeth. The concentration of the bleaching agent is lower than what your dentist would use in the office.</p>
						
						<h4>Root Canals</h4>
							<p>Inside the tooth, under the white enamel and a hard layer called the dentin, is a soft tissue called the pulp. The pulp contains blood vessels, nerves and connective tissue, and helps to grow the root of your tooth during development. In a fully developed tooth, the tooth can survive without the pulp because the tooth continues to be nourished by the tissues surrounding it.</p>

							<p>Contrary to jokes about the matter, modern endodontic treatment is very similar to having a routine filling and usually can be completed in one or two appointments, depending on the condition of your tooth and your personal circumstances. You can expect a comfortable experience during and after your appointment.</p>
								<p>
								<ul>
									<li>Saving the natural tooth with root canal treatment has many advantages</li>
									<li>Efficient chewing</li>
									<li>Normal biting force and sensation</li>
									<li>Natural appearance</li>
									<li>Protects other teeth from excessive wear or strain</li>
								</ul>
								</p>

					<h2>Dental Implants</h2>
						<h4>Dental Implants</h4>
							<p>A dental implant is an artificial tooth root that is placed into your jaw to hold a replacement tooth or bridge. Dental implants may be an option for people who have lost a tooth or teeth due to periodontal disease, an injury, or some other reason.</p>
								Types of dental Implants
							<p>	
							<ul>
								<li>Endosteal (in the bone): This is the most commonly used type of implant. The various types include screws, cylinders or blades surgically placed into the jawbone. Each implant holds one or more prosthetic teeth. This type of implant is generally used as an alternative for patients with bridges or removable dentures.</li>
								<li>Subperiosteal (on the bone): These are placed on top of the jaw with the metal framework's posts protruding through the gum to hold the prosthesis. These types of implants are used for patients who are unable to wear conventional dentures and who have minimal bone height.</li>
							</ul>
